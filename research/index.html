        		<h1>Research</h1>
			<p> As Co-Director of the <a class="highlight-text" href="https://icorelab.github.io/"> iCORE lab</a>, I am leading the <i> BlueFieldsRobotics </i> group. Our group is focused on developing robotic systems that are able to operate in complex and unstructured environments, focusing on topics such as control theory, motion and interaction planning, energy-efficient systems, and robot perception. Our research is applied to underwater robotic systems such as autonomous underwater vehicles, underwater vehicle-manipulator systems, mobile manipulation for personal & industrial environments, and robotic perception systems for bio-medical applications. </p>

				<!--<h2> Underwater Manipulation</h2>
				<p>  An underwater manipulator is a complex system, highly non-linear and subject to disturbances caused by underwater effects. To obtain a reliable system, robust control strategies have to be designed for the manipulator. My work is focused on the development of model-based low-level position/force control structures for underwater manipulators, both electric and hydraulic. This work is also centered on investigation into data-based dynamic modelling for underwater manipulators, incorporating  hydrodynamic effects and end-effector force contact with the environment. </p>

				<h2> Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</h2>
				<p>  Autonomous  underwater  vehicles  (AUVs) can  be  used  to  explore parts  of  the  ocean  that  were  previously  inaccessible  to mankind, e.g. below the ice sheets in the polar regions or confined underwater areas such as caves.  AUVs  have  a  wide  range  of  applications  from bathymetric mapping for scientific purposes, pipe inspection for the oil and gas industry or area surveillance for military
applications. My work focuses o developing control structures for these systems that will make them reliable to operate in unforseen conditions and robust to large disturbances. Furthermore, my interest rests in developing systems that will extend the autonomy of the AUVs by making them energy and cost efficient. </p>

			      <h2> Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator Systems</h2>
			      <p>  The interest in underwater vehicle manipulator systems has increased over the past years due to the need for interaction in underwater environments. Robots have been deployed to inspect and collect information for the oil and gas industry, military purposes and biological/geological studies. My work has focused in developing generalized models for underwater vehicle-manipulators that are able to estimate and analyze the effects between the vehicle and manipulator. These effects, also known as coupling effects, are significant and have to be understood as they can degrade the performence of the system lowering the manipulation precision and accuracy. Furthermore, my work has focused on developing control structures to compensate and address these coupling effects and improve the performence of the underwater vehicle-manipulator systems. </p>
