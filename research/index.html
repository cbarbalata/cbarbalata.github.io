        		<h1>Research</h1>
			<p> The research is focused on developing robotic systems that are able to operate in complex and unstructured environments. My areas of interest are control theory, motion and interaction planning, energy-efficient systems and robot perception. Passionate about exploring the depths of the ocean the research is applied to underwater robotic systems such as autonomous underwater vehicles and underwater vehicle-manipulator systems. But my interest into robotics is not limited to marine robotics. Other areas of applications I work in are mobile manipulation for personal environments and robotics for bio-medical applications. </p>

				<!--<h2> Underwater Manipulation</h2>
				<p>  An underwater manipulator is a complex system, highly non-linear and subject to disturbances caused by underwater effects. To obtain a reliable system, robust control strategies have to be designed for the manipulator. My work is focused on the development of model-based low-level position/force control structures for underwater manipulators, both electric and hydraulic. This work is also centered on investigation into data-based dynamic modelling for underwater manipulators, incorporating  hydrodynamic effects and end-effector force contact with the environment. </p>

				<p>  Autonomous  underwater  vehicles  (AUVs) can  be  used  to  explore parts  of  the  ocean  that  were  previously  inaccessible  to mankind, e.g. below the ice sheets in the polar regions or confined underwater areas such as caves.  AUVs  have  a  wide  range  of  applications  from bathymetric mapping for scientific purposes, pipe inspection for the oil and gas industry or area surveillance for military
applications. My work focuses o developing control structures for these systems that will make them reliable to operate in unforseen conditions and robust to large disturbances. Furthermore, my interest rests in developing systems that will extend the autonomy of the AUVs by making them energy and cost efficient. </p>
