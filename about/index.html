        		<h1>About</h1>
				<p>I am an Assistant Professor at Louisiana State University. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at University of Michigan and I obtained my PhD from Heriot-Watt University, United Kigdom and I have a double master degree in Computer Vision and Robotics from the University of Burgundy and  Heriot-Watt University as part of the VIBOT (VIsion and RoBOTtics) European program. </p>
				<p> The goal of my work is to propose solutions for real-world robotics applications with social and environmental merits. I am specifically interested in contributing to the widespread of mobile robotic systems
acting in complex, unstructured and dynamic environments, having an active role in improving their autonomy, energy-efficiency and reliability.</p>
